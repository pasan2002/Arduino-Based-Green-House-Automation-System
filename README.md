# Green House Automation System

This is an arduino based green house automation system we built. In this project we use two main sensors.
    
## Sensors

 - Soil Moisture Sensor
 - TEMT 6000 Ambient Light Sensor

## Other Components

 - ESP 32 Devkit V1
 - 9V Battery
 - Priming Diaphragm Water Pump 12V 
 - 5VDC 2 Way 2 Channel Relay Module With Coupling Protection
 - LED Bulbs
 - 5000 mAh power bank

## Getting Started
 - First you have to install Arduino IDE and install esp32(by espressif) board manager. When you try to connect esp32 board to your computer if there is no port assign to it you have to install "CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver" if you are a windows user.
 -  After that install the libraries that mention in my code.
 -  You have fillout template id, template name, ssid, pass, token fields with your own information. You don't need blynk related parts and wifi info in the code if you are not going to use the Blynk io application.
 -  You can customize and use freely this code anyway you want. When you use blynk io create virtual pins with the correct data streams.
